I am Cristian Consonni and I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Department 
of Information Engineering and Computer Science (DISI) at the
[University of Trento](http://www.unitn.it), Italy. 
I am part of the [dbTrento](http://db.disi.unitn.eu/) group.

My advisors are [Alberto Montresor](http://disi.unitn.it/~montreso/) and
[Yannis Velegrakis](http://disi.unitn.it/~velgias/).

## Research Interests

I am interested in machine learning and data mining techniques on time-evolving graphs.
This field has several applications in the domain of Big Data.
Graphs are fundamental structures that can encode many aspect of the data available
today in digital form.
This representation that is even more natural for anything on the Web: from the
link structure of the World Wide Web itself, the relations among individual in
social networks, the interactions among users on microblogging platforms, and the
semantic relations among concept in knowledge bases and among topics in
Wikipedia.
Many applications use graphs as a data structure to provide services as suggesting
friends on social networks, or answer queries on knowledge bases.

These applications require the ability to process massive graphs, furthermore
another common feature of these graphs is that they evolve with time, i.e. 
their node and edges vary at different point in time.

My research is funded by a grant of [SpazioDati s.r.l.](http://spaziodati.eu/)
