I am part of the [Big Data & Data Science][bigdata] unit.

I have earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2019 from the [University of Trento][unitn],
in Trento under the guidance of my advisors [Alberto Montresor][alberto]
and [Yannis Velegrakis][yannis].

My Ph.D. thesis was titled:

## Research Interests

My research encompasses the field of computational social science, data
mining, and knowledge extraction, with a particular focus on graphs.
I am as well interested in graph algorithms, machine learning, and
time-evolving graphs.

## Free and Open Culture

I am a [Wikipedian][wikipedia] since 2007, and a member of
[Wikimedia Italia][wmi] the local chapter of the [Wikimedia Foundation][wmf],
where I have served as member of the board from 2010 to 2017.

I am an advocate for _[free software][fsf]_ and _open knowledge_.
