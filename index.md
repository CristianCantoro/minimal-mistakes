# About me

I am Cristian Consonni and I am an Advanced Research Scientist at
[Eurecat - Centre Tecnològic de Catalunya][eurecat] in Barcelona.
I am part of the [Big Data & Data Science][bigdata] unit.

I have earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2019 from the [University of Trento][unitn],
in Trento with under the guidance of my advisors [Alberto Montresor][alberto]
and [Yannis Velegrakis][yannis].

My Ph.D. thesis was titled:
["The Dao of Wikipedia - Extracting Knowledge from the Structure of Wikilinks"][phd].

My Ph.D. program has been partially funded by [SpazioDati s.r.l.][spaziodati].

## Research Interests

My research encompasses in the field of data mining and knowledge extraction,
with a particular focus on graphs.
I am interested in graph algorithms, machine learning, and data mining
techniques on graphs and time-evolving graphs.

Graphs are fundamental structures that can encode many aspects of the data
available today in digital form. Many applications use graphs as a data
structure to provide services as suggesting friends on social networks or
answer queries on knowledge bases. These applications require the ability to
process massive graphs. Furthermore, another common feature of these graphs is
that they evolve with time, i.e., their node and edges vary at different
times.

I am a [Wikipedian][wikipedia] since 2007, and a member of [Wikimedia
Italia][wmi] the local chapter of the [Wikimedia Foundation][wmf], where I
have served as member of the board from 2010 to 2017.

I am an advocate for _[free software][fsf]_ and _open knowledge_.
