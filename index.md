# About me

I am a scientific project officier at the [European Center for Algorithmic Transparency (ECAT)][ecat], part of the [Joint Research Centre (JRC)][jrc] in Ispra (VA), Italy.

In my role, I contribute scientific and technical expertise in support of policie in the context of online platforms [Digital Services Act (DSA)][dsa] and on artificial intelligence [AI-Act][aiact].

Previously I have worked as Advanced Research Scientist at [Eurecat - Centre Tecnol√≤gic de Catalunya][eurecat] in Barcelona, as part of the [Big Data & Data Science][bigdata] unit. While I was there I have served as Principal Investigator for the [MoTiV][motiv] project and as Work Package leader for the [Ride2Rail][ride2rail] project. 

I have earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2019 from the [University of Trento][unitn],
in Trento under the guidance of my advisors [Alberto Montresor][alberto] and [Yannis Velegrakis][yannis]. My Ph.D. thesis was titled:
["The Dao of Wikipedia - Extracting Knowledge from the Structure of Wikilinks"][phd].
My Ph.D. program has been partially funded by [SpazioDati s.r.l.][spaziodati].

My research encompasses the fields of computational social science, data mining, and knowledge extraction, with a particular focus on graphs. I am as well interested in graph algorithms, machine learning, and time-evolving graphs.

I am a [Wikipedian][wikipedia] since 2007, and a member of [Wikimedia Italia][wmi] the local chapter of the [Wikimedia Foundation][wmf], where I have served as member of the board from 2010 to 2017.

I am an advocate for _[free software][fsf]_ and _open knowledge_.
