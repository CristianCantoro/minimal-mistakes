# Academic Personal Webpage 

This is my personal webpage at the [University of Trento](http://Www.unitn.it).
The site is generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and the layout is
"[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)"
by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes).

Check out the [setup guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/)
to have further information on how to create a site like this.
