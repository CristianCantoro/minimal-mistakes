These are my publications (complete Curriculum Vitæ: [en](CV_Consonni_public_en.pdf), [it](CV_Consonni_public_it.pdf)).

These works have been developed while I was at [Università degli studi di Milano-Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it), at [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](http://www.fbk.eu) or during projects done by [Wikimedia Italia](http://www.wikimedia.it).

### Bachelor and Master Thesis

I have received both my BSc in Physics and my MSc in computational physics 
from the [University of Milano-Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it) (UniMiB), Milan.

* *Bachelor Thesis*
For my Bachelor thesis I was supervised by [Marco Paganoni](http://fisica.mib.infn.it/pages/it/chi-siamo/persone/who.php?user=paganoni&lang=IT) and Roberto Salerno. I worked in High Energy Physics with the [CMS](http://cms.web.cern.ch/) group at UniMiB/INFN Milano-Bicocca at CERN in Geneva.

* *Master Thesis*
I did my Master thesis with [Leonardo Giusti](http://virgilio.mib.infn.it/~lgiusti/lgiusti.html) in computational physics.
: [ _“Applications of the Wilson Flow in Lattice Gauge Theory”_](files/MSc_thesis_Cristian_Consonni.pdf) ([final presentation](files/MSc_thesis_presentation_Cristian_Consonni.pdf))
