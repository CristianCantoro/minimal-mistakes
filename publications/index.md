### Bachelor and Master Thesis

I have received both my BSc in Physics and my MSc in computational physics 
from the [University of Milano-Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it) (UniMiB), Milan.

For my Bachelor thesis I was supervised by [Marco Paganoni](http://fisica.mib.infn.it/pages/it/chi-siamo/persone/who.php?user=paganoni&lang=IT)
with Roberto Salerno. I worked in High Energy Physics with the [CMS](http://cms.web.cern.ch/)
group at UniMiB/INFN Milano-Bicocca at CERN in Geneva. 

I did my Master thesis under [Leonardo Giusti](http://virgilio.mib.infn.it/~lgiusti/lgiusti.html) 
in computational physics.
