Cristian Consonni is an advanced research scientist at Eurecat, Centre Tecnològic de Catalunya in
Barcelona. Cristian obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Trento in 2019.
In his thesis, he studies how knowledge emerges from the structure of links in Wikipedia. Still, he
is a theoretical physicist by training, having obtained an M.Sc. in Physics from the University of
Milano-Bicocca. His research interests cover computational social science, data mining, and
knowledge extraction, focusing on graphs. He is also a free software activist, and he has
participated in the organization of many international projects related to free and open culture.

These are my publications (complete Curriculum Vitæ: [en][encv], [it][itcv]).
